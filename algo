Algorithm for computing the sum of series using a finite number of terms with convergence criterion 'e'

1.Set the initial value of 'sum' as 0.
2.Set the initial value of 'n' as 0.
3.Enter the value of 'x'
4.Add the next term Sn=x^n to the sum 'sum'
5.Check if the convergence criterion Sn/sum<e is satisfied
6.If the convergence criterion is satisfied,stop and print the results on 'n','sum','error' and 'e'
7.If the convergence criterion is not satisfied,advance 'n' by 1 and go back to step 4.
8.Continue till convergence criterion is satisfied or a given maxium value of 'n' is reached.
